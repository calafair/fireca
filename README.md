# Hey there!

Fireca is a web desktop for your computer. It consists of the basic apps, 
such as a calculator, dashboard, news widget, web browser, arcade, etc.

> ### What's the point?
> Usually, if you have lots of browser tabs or apps open, your computer will slow down, and it might give you a headache just looking at your screen. 
With Fireca, you can cut down on the apps and browser tabs you have, lowering the load on
your computer (and yourself).

## Recent updates
Fireca has recently been migrated to the new [Vercel site](https://fireca.vercel.app), and our team is working on a developer page, so updates will be less frequent
in the next several days.

## Upcoming Updates

Here's what Fireca looks like right now (as of Sep 15, 2021):
