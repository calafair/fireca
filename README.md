# Hey there!

Fireca is a web desktop for your computer. It consists of the basic apps, 
such as a calculator, dashboard, news widget, web browser, arcade, etc.

> ### What's the point?
> Usually, if you have lots of browser tabs or apps open, your computer will slow down, and it might give you a headache just looking at your screen. 
With Fireca, you can cut down on the apps and browser tabs you have, lowering the load on
your computer (and yourself).
